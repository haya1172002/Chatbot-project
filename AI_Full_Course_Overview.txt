AI FULL COURSE OVERVIEW

This AI course provides a complete roadmap from basic programming to advanced Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). It combines theoretical knowledge and hands-on implementation using Python and R programming languages.

1. PROGRAMMING FOUNDATIONS
- Python: The core language used in AI and ML. Covers syntax, data types, loops, functions, and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- R: Focused on data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.

2. MACHINE LEARNING (ML)
- Understanding supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
- Algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN.
- Using scikit-learn for model training, testing, and evaluation.
- Feature Engineering – transforming raw data into meaningful input for models.

3. DEEP LEARNING (DL)
- Building neural networks using TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
- Concepts: activation functions, loss functions, backpropagation, and optimization.
- Advanced architectures: CNN, RNN, LSTM, GANs, VAEs.

4. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- Applications: text classification, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and language translation.
- Using pre-trained models and embeddings for LLMs.

5. TIME SERIES (TS) ANALYSIS
- Forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM for sequential data.
- Applications: stock prediction, temperature forecasting, and sales analysis.

6. GENERATIVE AI (GENAI)
- Creating new content (text, images, audio) using AI models.
- Working with LLMs, Diffusion Models, GANs, and VAEs.
- Tools: Ollama, LangChain, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

7. LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLM)
- Understanding architecture (transformers, attention mechanism).
- Building and running LLMs locally using Ollama.
- Using LangChain to connect models with external data, APIs, and vector databases.

8. COMPUTER VISION (CV)
- OpenCV for image processing, filtering, and transformation.
- Face Detection and Object Detection using SSD, YOLO, and Haar cascades.
- Fire Detection and anomaly detection using custom-trained CNN models.

9. DATA HANDLING AND ETL
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): moving data from raw sources to usable formats.
- Data Wrangling, Manipulation, and Transformation using Pandas and NumPy.
- Data Preprocessing: cleaning, normalizing, and preparing data for ML/DL.

10. DATA VISUALIZATION & ANALYSIS
- Creating visual insights with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends.

11. SPEECH RECOGNITION & ETHICS
- Speech Recognition: converting spoken words to text using AI models.
